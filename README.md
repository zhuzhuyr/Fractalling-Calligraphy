# Fractalling-Calligraphy


Project Description:
====
The element of "repetition" is often present in our view. Repetitive works of art, repetitive exercises of a skill. Repetitive patterns are even more ubiquitous in the natural world. Through my research I discovered that fractal art is an art form based on repetition and iteration. The logic behind the art of calligraphy, as an art form based on natural philosophy, is in fact very similar to that of fractal art. So I began to think about how to make the two interact in a combined way. Fractalling Calligraphy is an interactive experience about calligraphy and fractal art. In this project you can experience the concept of digital calligraphy and controlled fractals. By constructing elements that are repeated over and over again the complete art form is eventually formed. This project will bring together a new experience of both.

The colour scheme of the interface comes from the colour palette of Chinese calligraphy works.

The project is based on p5.js.

The project is divided into three main experiential sections.

1. A free experience of digital calligraphy, while practising with calligraphy images. Try to slowly find your way to mastering it while using the digital brush. This may take more than one attempt.

2. Control the direction and opening and closing of fractal tree generation by drawing lines.

3. Draw the shape in the specified area and click on start to create your own fractal tree.
